# Trinity Protocol Architecture

## Overview

Trinity Protocol is Chronos Vault's revolutionary cross-chain security system that provides mathematically proven 2-of-3 consensus across three independent blockchains: Arbitrum Layer 2, Solana, and TON.

## Core Components

### 1. **Event Listener System**

Real-time monitoring of vault operations across all three chains:

- **Arbitrum Event Listener** (`arbitrum-event-listener.ts`)
  - Monitors ChronosVault contract events on Arbitrum Sepolia
  - Tracks: VaultCreated, VaultUnlocked, VaultDeposit, VaultWithdrawal, CrossChainVerification
  - Uses ethers.js WebSocket connection for real-time events
  - Implements missed event recovery via polling

- **Solana Event Listener** (`solana-event-listener.ts`)
  - Monitors Chronos Vault Solana Program account changes
  - Tracks: VaultInitialized, StateUpdated, CrossChainConsensus
  - Uses Solana WebSocket subscription for program accounts
  - Parses program logs for event extraction

- **TON Event Listener** (`ton-event-listener.ts`)
  - Monitors ChronosVault TON contract state changes
  - Tracks: BackupUpdated, EmergencyRecoveryTriggered
  - Uses polling mechanism (TON doesn't support WebSockets)
  - Implements quantum-resistant backup verification

### 2. **Trinity State Coordinator**

The orchestrator that ties everything together (`trinity-state-coordinator.ts`):

- **Responsibilities:**
  - Aggregates events from all three chains
  - Maintains cross-chain state consistency
  - Triggers Trinity Protocol verification
  - Coordinates emergency recovery

- **Event Flow:**
  ```
  Arbitrum Vault Unlock Event
    ↓
  State Coordinator detects event
    ↓
  Triggers Trinity Protocol 2-of-3 verification
    ↓
  Verifies on: Arbitrum ✅ + Solana ✅ + TON ✅
    ↓
  Consensus reached (2 of 3) → Operation approved
  ```

- **State Tracking:**
  - Tracks vault state on each chain
  - Monitors consensus status
  - Maintains sync timestamps
  - Emits cross-chain events

### 3. **Merkle Proof Verification**

Cryptographic state validation system (`merkle-proof-verifier.ts`):

- **Capabilities:**
  - Generate Merkle trees from vault states
  - Create proofs for individual vaults
  - Verify cross-chain consensus proofs
  - State root synchronization

- **Proof Structure:**
  ```typescript
  interface CrossChainStateProof {
    vaultId: string;
    arbitrumProof: MerkleProof;
    solanaProof: MerkleProof;
    tonProof: MerkleProof;
    consensusRoot: string;
    timestamp: number;
  }
  ```

- **Verification Process:**
  1. Hash vault state on each chain
  2. Build Merkle tree from all vault states
  3. Generate proof for target vault
  4. Verify proof mathematically
  5. Create consensus root from all chain roots

### 4. **Emergency Recovery System**

Automated failover and recovery infrastructure:

#### Circuit Breaker Service (`circuit-breaker-service.ts`)

- **Pattern:** Implements circuit breaker pattern for each chain
- **States:** CLOSED (normal) → OPEN (failed) → HALF_OPEN (testing)
- **Thresholds:**
  - Failure threshold: 3 consecutive failures
  - Timeout threshold: 5 seconds
  - Reset timeout: 30 seconds
  - Half-open timeout: 10 seconds

- **Health Monitoring:**
  - Checks every 5 seconds
  - Tracks response times
  - Counts failures
  - Auto-recovery attempts

#### Emergency Recovery Protocol (`emergency-recovery-protocol.ts`)

- **Recovery Modes:**
  - **NORMAL:** All 3 chains operational
  - **DEGRADED:** 2 chains operational (reduced redundancy)
  - **CRITICAL:** Only 1 chain operational (2-of-3 impossible)
  - **EMERGENCY:** Manual intervention required

- **Failover Strategy:**
  1. Detect chain failure via circuit breaker
  2. Attempt automated recovery (3 attempts)
  3. If recovery fails, activate emergency mode
  4. Coordinate with remaining healthy chains
  5. Preserve state during recovery

- **Emergency Vault Recovery:**
  - Requires all 3 chains for approval
  - Uses recovery key verification
  - Implements multi-sig coordination
  - Logs all emergency actions

## Trinity Protocol Verification Flow

### Standard Operation (2-of-3 Consensus)

```
1. User initiates vault operation (unlock, withdraw)
   ↓
2. Arbitrum contract emits event
   ↓
3. Event listener detects and forwards to State Coordinator
   ↓
4. State Coordinator creates verification request
   ↓
5. Trinity Protocol verifies on all 3 chains:
   - Arbitrum: Check unlock conditions
   - Solana: Verify cross-chain state
   - TON: Validate backup integrity
   ↓
6. Calculate consensus: 2 of 3 chains must agree
   ↓
7. Generate Merkle proof of consensus
   ↓
8. Update vault state across all chains
   ↓
9. Emit consensus event
```

### Emergency Recovery Flow

```
1. Circuit breaker detects multiple chain failures
   ↓
2. Emergency Recovery Protocol activates
   ↓
3. Evaluate recovery mode (DEGRADED/CRITICAL/EMERGENCY)
   ↓
4. Attempt automated chain recovery
   ↓
5. If automated recovery fails:
   - Require all 3 chains for emergency approval
   - Validate recovery key
   - Execute emergency vault recovery
   ↓
6. Preserve vault state during recovery
   ↓
7. Resume normal operation when chains recover
```
