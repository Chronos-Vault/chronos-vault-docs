## 🔐 Security Features

### Trinity Protocol 2-of-3 Consensus

**Mathematical Security Guarantee:**
```
Attack Success Probability = P(compromise 2+ independent chains)

For Trinity Protocol:
P(attack) = P(ETH ∩ SOL) + P(ETH ∩ TON) + P(SOL ∩ TON) + P(ETH ∩ SOL ∩ TON)

With independent chain security:
P(attack) ≈ 0 (mathematically negligible)
```

**Security Layers:**

1. ✅ **Multi-Chain Consensus** - No single point of failure
2. ✅ **Merkle Proof Validation** - Cryptographic verification
3. ✅ **Circuit Breaker System** - Automated anomaly detection
4. ✅ **Tiered Detection** - Gas-optimized security checks
5. ✅ **Formal Verification** - Mathematically proven correctness
6. ✅ **Emergency Controls** - Manual override capabilities
