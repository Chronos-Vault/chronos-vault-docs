# Contributing to Chronos Vault

## Welcome to the Future of Blockchain Security

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Chronos Vault - the world's first **mathematically provable** blockchain security platform. We're building something unprecedented: a system where every security claim is backed by cryptographic proof, not human promises.

## Our Vision

**"Trust Math, Not Humans"**

In a world of hacks, exploits, and trust-based vulnerabilities, Chronos Vault provides **mathematical guarantees**. We're not just building another vault - we're creating a new paradigm where security is provable, governance is trustless, and users have absolute confidence in their asset protection.

### What Makes This Special

- **Formal Verification**: 35/35 theorems proven with Lean 4 - not audited, **mathematically proven**
- **Trinity Protocol**: 2-of-3 consensus across independent blockchains (Arbitrum, Solana, TON)
- **AI + Cryptographic Governance**: "AI decides, Math proves, Chain executes"
- **Quantum-Resistant**: Ready for the post-quantum era with ML-KEM-1024 + Dilithium-5
- **100% Open Source**: Every line of code, every proof, every design decision

## How to Contribute

### 1. Choose Your Path

#### üîê Security & Cryptography
Work on the Mathematical Defense Layer:
- Zero-knowledge proof circuits (Circom/SnarkJS)
- Formal verification (Lean 4 theorem prover)
- Quantum-resistant cryptography (ML-KEM, Dilithium)
- Multi-party computation (Shamir Secret Sharing)
- Verifiable delay functions (Wesolowski VDF)

#### üåê Smart Contracts
Enhance Trinity Protocol:
- Solidity contracts (Ethereum/Arbitrum)
- Solana programs (Rust/Anchor)
- TON contracts (FunC)
- Cross-chain bridges and atomic swaps

#### üíª Platform Development
Build user experience:
- React frontend with immersive 3D visualizations
- Express backend with WebSocket real-time updates
- Multi-wallet integration
- Monitoring dashboards

#### üìö Documentation & Education
Help the world understand:
- Technical documentation
- Security architecture guides
- Developer tutorials
- Mathematical proof explanations

### 2. Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Chronos-Vault/chronos-vault-platform-.git
cd chronos-vault-platform-

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Add your configuration

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

### 3. Development Workflow

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create a feature branch**: `git checkout -b feat/amazing-feature`
3. **Write code** following our standards
4. **Test thoroughly** - we're protecting real assets
5. **Commit** with clear messages: `feat(module): add feature`
6. **Push** to your fork
7. **Open a Pull Request** with detailed description

### 4. Code Standards

#### Security First
- Every function that touches assets must be thoroughly tested
- No shortcuts, no "TODO: add security later"
- If you can't prove it's secure, don't ship it

#### Clean Code
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Comprehensive JSDoc comments
- Clear variable/function names

#### Testing
- Unit tests for all business logic
- Integration tests for cross-chain operations
- End-to-end tests for user flows

#### Commit Messages
Follow conventional commits:
- `feat(module): add new feature`
- `fix(module): resolve bug`
- `docs(module): update documentation`
- `test(module): add test coverage`

## Community Values

### üéØ Excellence Over Speed
We'd rather take time to get it right than ship fast and break things.

### üî¨ Science Over Hype
Every claim must be provable. We don't market vaporware.

### üåç Collaboration Over Competition
We're all building the future together.

### üíé Open Source Over Closed Doors
Transparency builds trust.
