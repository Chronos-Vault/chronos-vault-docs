# Contributing to Chronos Vault

## Welcome to the Future of Blockchain Security

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Chronos Vault - the world's first **mathematically provable** blockchain security platform. We're building something unprecedented: a system where every security claim is backed by cryptographic proof, not human promises.

## Our Vision

**"Trust Math, Not Humans"**

In a world of hacks, exploits, and trust-based vulnerabilities, Chronos Vault provides **mathematical guarantees**. We're not just building another vault - we're creating a new paradigm where security is provable, governance is trustless, and users have absolute confidence in their asset protection.

### What Makes This Special

- **Formal Verification**: 35/35 theorems proven with Lean 4 - not audited, **mathematically proven**
- **Trinity Protocol**: 2-of-3 consensus across independent blockchains (Arbitrum, Solana, TON)
- **AI + Cryptographic Governance**: "AI decides, Math proves, Chain executes"
- **Quantum-Resistant**: Ready for the post-quantum era with ML-KEM-1024 + Dilithium-5
- **100% Open Source**: Every line of code, every proof, every design decision

lake build
```

### 3. Development Workflow

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create a feature branch**: `git checkout -b feat/amazing-feature`
3. **Write code** following our standards (see below)
4. **Test thoroughly** - we're protecting real assets
5. **Add tests** for new functionality
6. **Update documentation** if needed
7. **Commit** with clear messages: `feat(module): add quantum-safe key rotation`
8. **Push** to your fork
9. **Open a Pull Request** with detailed description

### 4. Code Standards

#### Security First
- Every function that touches assets must be formally verified
- No shortcuts, no "TODO: add security later"
- If you can't prove it mathematically, don't ship it

#### Clean Code
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Comprehensive JSDoc comments
- Clear variable/function names
- No magic numbers or hardcoded values

#### Testing
- Unit tests for all business logic
- Integration tests for cross-chain operations
- End-to-end tests for user flows
- Formal verification for security-critical code

#### Commit Messages
Follow conventional commits:
- `feat(module): add new feature`
- `fix(module): resolve bug`
- `docs(module): update documentation`
- `test(module): add test coverage`
- `refactor(module): improve code structure`

## Mathematical Rigor

When contributing to security modules:

### Required for All Cryptographic Code:
1. **Formal specification** - Write what the code should do mathematically
2. **Implementation** - Write the actual code
3. **Formal proof** - Prove it's correct using Lean 4
4. **Tests** - Verify it works in practice

### Example Workflow:
```lean
-- Formal specification (Lean 4)
theorem vdf_time_lock_secure (t : ‚Ñï) (computation : VDFComputation) :
  computation.iterations = t ‚Üí
  ‚àÄ (faster_computation : Computation),
    faster_computation.output = computation.output ‚Üí
    faster_computation.time ‚â• t
```

```typescript
// Implementation (TypeScript)
export class VDFTimeLock {
  computeProof(iterations: number): VDFProof {
    // Implementation proven correct by Lean theorem above
  }
}
```

```typescript
// Tests
test('VDF cannot be bypassed', async () => {
  const vdf = new VDFTimeLock();
  const proof = await vdf.computeProof(1000000);
  expect(proof.verified).toBe(true);
});
```

## Community Values

### üéØ Excellence Over Speed
We'd rather take time to get it right than ship fast and break things. Assets are at stake.

### üî¨ Science Over Hype
Every claim must be provable. We don't market vaporware.

### üåç Collaboration Over Competition
